It is general advice to use a virtual env to test or run programs, so you might want to clone this repo into a virtual env since we would need to install three packages(faker, configparser and boto3)

1) CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (for a LINUX OS, kindly look up the web for Mac & Windows)
-- open up the repo folder in your TERMINAL
-- create virtual environment
>> $ virtualenv <any_name>

--activate virtualenv
>> $ source bin/activate
'NOTE: the name of your virtualenv appears in a bracket starting ur filepath, indicating env is successfully activated'

2) PACKAGES/LIBRARY TO INSTALL
>> $ pip install boto3
>> $ pip install configparser
>> $ pip install faker

3) To successfully run this program, you have to create an Amazon S3 bucket  which is "publicly accessible". Please do check the web for further information on creating a s3 bucket (it is quite simple).

4) Create a file "connection.conf"  to place in your AWS login credentials for the s3 bucket (i've '.gitignore' mine).
Supply this into the file:

 ---
[aws_boto_credentials]
access_key = <put_in_ur_info>
secret_key = <put_in_ur_info>
bucket_name = <put_in_ur_info>
account_id = <put_in_ur_info>
 ---

5) Now  RUN the program (main.py) in your favourite IDE or terminal.

6) Check your S3 bucket to verify.

7) POSSIBLE ERRORS
-- Ensure your internet connection is on.
-- Ensure your s3 bucket is "publicly accessible".
-- Ensure the 'connection.conf' path is within the folder or path clearly stated.
