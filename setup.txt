It is general advice to use a virtual env to test or run programs, so you might want to clone this repo into a virtual env since we would need to install three packages(faker, configparser and boto3)

1) CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (for a LINUX OS, kindly look up the web for Mac & Windows)
-- open up the repo folder in your TERMINAL
-- create virtual environment
>> $ virtualenv <any_name>

--activate virtualenv
>> $ source bin/activate
'NOTE: the name of your virtualenv appears in a bracket starting ur filepath, indicating env is successfully activated'

2) PACKAGES/LIBRARY TO INSTALL
>> $ pip install -r requirement.txt

3) Create a file "connection.conf"  to place in your AWS login credentials for the s3 bucket (i've '.gitignore' mine).
Supply this into the file:
 ---
[aws_boto_credentials]
access_key = <put_in_ur_info>
secret_key = <put_in_ur_info>
bucket_name = <put_in_ur_info>
account_id = <put_in_ur_info>
 ---

4) POSSIBLE ERRORS
-- Ensure your internet connection is on.
-- Ensure the 'connection.conf' path is within the folder or path clearly stated.
